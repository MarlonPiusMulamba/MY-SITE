  <h6><strong>A simple story good to know.</strong></h6>
  <p>
    <q>Once upon a time, there was a programming team that was working on a new software release. They had been working on it for months, and it was finally ready for testing.
        
    The QA team tested the software thoroughly, and they didn't find any bugs. The developers were confident that the software was ready to be released, so they deployed it to production.
        
   The software release went smoothly, and the users were happy. But then, a few days later, one of the users reported a bug. The developers were surprised and disappointed, but they immediately started working on a fix.
      
    They found the bug and fixed it, but when they deployed the fix, it caused a new bug. And then another bug. And another.
        
    The developers were starting to get frustrated. They couldn't figure out why the software was becoming so buggy.
        
    Finally, one of the developers suggested that they follow the programming slogan "when it works, don't touch it." They decided to stop deploying any new fixes, even if they knew about bugs.
        
    At first, the users were unhappy, but the developers explained to them that they were trying to avoid making the software even more buggy.
        
    After a few weeks, the users realized that the software was actually more stable than before. They were willing to live with a few bugs, as long as the software didn't crash or lose their data.
        
    The developers learned a valuable lesson that day. Sometimes, the best way to fix a software bug is to leave it alone.
        
    Of course, this is a humorous story, and it's not always the best advice to follow in the real world. Sometimes, it is necessary to fix bugs, even if it means deploying new code. But the story does illustrate the importance of caution and careful testing when making changes to software. </q>

    <p>Am Marlon Pius alias Pythonista, who, like a sleeping lion, is always humble and meek. as touching the most pressing part of their being.
        My humble soul passes throughout the community as the "Quiet Dynamo." Very were social, interactive, and quite funny, like a seasoned storyteller who could make the entire room erupt with laughter. I like making my presence in any society to always  be a source of joy, and a knack for turning even the most mundane conversations into memorable experiences.
        But when duty calls, the Quiet Dynamo in me transforms into an unstoppable force, like a river rushing through the heart of the mountains. With a heart full of zeal and enthusiasm, I stand up for work, tirelessly and with an unwavering commitment, as if I have an inner fire burning, guiding my every move.
        Minimum supervision is what I need, for my dedication and work ethic are like a compass, pointing me in the right direction. People marveled at how i could take charge and lead with the wisdom of an elder, even when am still considered young in years. In this, they embodied the proverb: "Still waters run deep."
        
        In my village, there was a saying that went, "When you want a job done with precision and passion, look to the Quiet Dynamo." I was a living testament to the power of a humble heart, a quick wit, and a fierce dedication to my work.
